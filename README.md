Creation of a repository in order to learn about GitHub
I am supposed to write a little bit about myself here in order to create an updated version of the readme file. I am 50 years old, married with a stepson who is married.  My stepson has a stepdaughter and a son.  The stepdaughter is 8 years old and his son is going to be 4 years old in February.  I work for a local utility company at one of their nuclear powered electricity generating station.  I work in the Online Scheduling department where I am currently performing duties of a Work Week Manager which matches my title however my job description is Preventive Maintenance Coordinator.  Our department is still trying to staff up after some retirements and job changes that left us down by 4 people.  This has caused me to have to temporarily execute duty work weeks which includes long hours to coordinate the schedule of all work being performed on site.  We have 2 new hires that are coming up to speed and getting qualified but they will not take their first work weeks until 2021.  There are 2 more remaining postings to be filled with the intention to have those filled within the year.
